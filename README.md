## Project Summary:
This project is aimed at analyzing data related to car theft crimes in a particular state. The data will be used to answer various questions posed by the police department in order to strategize and maintain peace and order in the state. The project will involve cleaning and analyzing the data to provide insights and recommendations to the police department.

## Project Motivation:
Car theft is a serious crime that not only results in significant financial losses for individuals but also poses a threat to public safety. The police department of a particular state is committed to ensuring the safety of its citizens and reducing the number of car theft crimes in the state. To achieve this goal, they are turning to data analysis to gain insights and make informed decisions. As a data analyst, I have been tasked with cleaning and analyzing the data related to car theft crimes in the state. By analyzing this data, I will be able to provide the police department with valuable insights and recommendations that will help them make data-driven decisions to reduce car theft crimes in the state. Overall, this project is aimed at using data analysis to make a positive impact on public safety and help the police department in its efforts to maintain peace and order in the state.

## Business problems:
* On which month did the lowest and highest motor vehicle thefts occur?
* On which month highest and lowest percentage arrests occur?
* On which weekday did most motor vehicle thefts occur?
* Determine the percentage arrests on different weekdays
* Determining percentage of arrests in different months
* What are the number of arrests and crimes committed in each year?
* Which are the top five locations for motor vehicle thefts?

## Data Columns details:
* ID: a unique identifier for each observation.
* Date: the date the crime occurred. LocationDescription: the location where the crime occurred.
* Arrest: whether or not an arrest was made for the crime (TRUE if an arrest was made, and FALSE if an arrest was not made).
* Domestic: whether or not the crime was a domestic crime, meaning that it was committed against a family member (TRUE if it was domestic, and FALSE if it was not domestic).
* Beat: the area, or "beat" in which the crime occurred. This is the smallest regional division defined by the Chicago police department.
* District: the police district in which the crime occured. Each district is composed of many beats, and are defined by the Chicago Police Department.
* CommunityArea: the community area in which the crime occurred. Since the 1920s, Chicago has been divided into what are called "community areas", of which there are now * 77. The community areas were devised in an attempt to create socially homogeneous regions.
* Year: the year in which the crime occurred. Latitude: the latitude of the location at which the crime occurred.

## Conclusion:
* By doing the exploratory data analysis we can help the Chicago crime investigative unit by providing insights and helping them in reducing the crimes In conclusion, this data analysis project aimed to provide valuable insights and recommendations to the police department of a particular state regarding car theft crimes.
* The analysis of the data revealed several important findings that can help the police department in its efforts to reduce car theft crimes in the state.
* Firstly, the analysis showed that the highest number of car theft crimes occurred in the month of October, and the lowest number of crimes occurred in the month of February. This information can be used to strategically allocate police resources and increase surveillance during the months when car theft crimes are more likely to occur.
* Secondly, the analysis showed that the majority of car theft crimes occurred on the streets. This information can be used to increase security measures in these areas, such as installing security cameras and increasing patrolling by law enforcement officers.
* Finally, the analysis showed that a large proportion of car theft crimes occurred on Friday, possibly end of the week. This information can be used to increase police presence during these days and increase the visibility of law enforcement officers to deter potential criminals.
Overall, the insights and recommendations provided by this data analysis project can be used by the police department to develop data-driven strategies to reduce car theft crimes in the state and improve public safety.
